== Part 1

> Ja mei, is' denn scho Weihnachten?

Such an easy task.. afraid of what's going to happen in part2.
Build a few tests, a little loop, debugged for a few minutes to learn how Ruby deals with `each_with_index` scenarios in a reduce situation.

== Part 2

Thought longer than I had to before I started implementing this.
Only had some point I went wrong and that was how I interpreted the "infinite loop stop" scenario - I thought if ANY players deck repeats it stops but they need to be in exactly the same configuration.
Code does not terminate anymore :(
