== Part 1

Figuring out how to deal with hexagons was annoying.
Was not paying enough attention at first to understand that (un)even rows behave different.
After a good night's sleep this made sense and finally got it working.

Implemented the hexagon _movement_ logic in a `Tile` class.

* create reference tile
* initialize empty array of visited tiles
* for each instruction walk to target tile
* if it does not exist in visited tile array, create a new tile
* flip the tile
* after all lines are parsed, count the tiles in the array that are black
